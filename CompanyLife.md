# Company Life

Welcome to Reservia! Here is some information that will be useful to keep on hand at all times: 
* Working hours are from **9am - Noon 1h30pm - 5h30pm**. These hours can be ajusted, but make sure to inform your manager. 
* Remote work or tele-work is possible one day per week. Your presence on Tuesdays is required as it is our company-wide meeting day. 
* Cleaning Technicians come in every Monday evening and Thursday evening. Please tidy up your desk to make the cleaning process easier for them.
